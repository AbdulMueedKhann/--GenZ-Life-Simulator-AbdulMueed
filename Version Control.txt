Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time. 
It allows me to see the history of my project, undo changes if needed, 
and work on different features safely. Git makes collaboration easier.
I learned that Git helps me track every change I make to my project. 
It lets me see the history and go back if something breaks. 
This is very useful for coding projects.
